/*
  # Add project sharing functionality

  1. New Tables
    - `project_shares`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `project_id` (uuid, references customers)
      - `customer_id` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `designer_email` (text)
      - `designer_phone` (text)
      - `message` (text)
      - `status` (text, default 'sent')
      - `created_at` (timestamp)
      - `updated_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `project_shares` table
    - Add policies for customers to manage their shares
    - Add policies for designers to view shares sent to them
