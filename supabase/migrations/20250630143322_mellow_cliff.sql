  # Create project images storage bucket

  1. New Storage
    - Creates a public storage bucket for project images
    - Sets up appropriate access policies for the bucket
  2. Security
    - Allows public read access to all files
    - Restricts upload/update/delete to authenticated users
    - Users can only modify their own files
