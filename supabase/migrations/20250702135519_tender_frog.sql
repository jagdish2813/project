  # Create storage bucket for project images with policy existence checks

  1. New Storage
    - Creates a storage bucket for project images if it doesn't exist
    - Sets up appropriate security policies with existence checks
  
  2. Security
    - Enables public read access to all files
    - Allows authenticated users to upload files
    - Restricts update/delete to file owners
