/*
  # Add Admin RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Add RLS policies to allow admin users full access to all tables
    - Admins can view designers, customers, and other data
    - Policies check the admin_users table to verify admin status

  2. Security
    - Only active admins from admin_users table get access
    - All existing policies remain in place for regular users
