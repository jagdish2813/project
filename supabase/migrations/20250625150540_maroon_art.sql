  # Fix Designer Project Access Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies for designers to view assigned projects
    - Allow designers to update projects they are assigned to
    - Fix project_shares policy for designer access
    - Create view for designer assigned projects (without RLS on view)

  2. Changes
    - Drop and recreate specific policies with better logic
    - Create helper view for designer assigned projects
    - Ensure proper access control for designers and customers
