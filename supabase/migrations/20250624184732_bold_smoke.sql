/*
  # Create 2D Design Tool Tables

  1. New Tables
    - `design_projects` - Store 2D design projects
    - `design_rooms` - Store room data for designs
    - `design_furniture` - Store furniture items in designs
    - `design_walls` - Store wall data for designs

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for customers to manage their own designs
