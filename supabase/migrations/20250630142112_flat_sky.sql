/*
  # Fix project-images storage bucket

  1. New Storage Bucket
    - Create a new storage bucket for project images
    - Set up public access for project images
    - Configure RLS policies for the bucket

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on the bucket
    - Add policies for users to manage their own images
    - Allow public read access to images
