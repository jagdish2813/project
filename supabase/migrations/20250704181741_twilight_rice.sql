  # Fix Quote Sending to Customers

  1. Issues Fixed
    - Fix the issue where quotes sent by designers don't appear for customers
    - Update the status field when a designer sends a quote
    - Ensure proper RLS policies for quote visibility

  2. Changes
    - Add a function to update quote status when sent
    - Create a trigger to automatically update the status
    - Fix RLS policies for better quote visibility
    - Create a comprehensive view for customer quotes with items
