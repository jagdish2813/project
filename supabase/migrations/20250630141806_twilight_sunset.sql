/*
  # Add Project Team Members Table

  1. New Tables
    - `project_team_members` - Store team members for projects
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `project_id` (uuid, references customers)
      - `name` (text)
      - `role` (text)
      - `contact` (text)
      - `added_by` (uuid, references designers)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on the table
    - Add policies for designers to manage team members
    - Add policies for customers to view team members
