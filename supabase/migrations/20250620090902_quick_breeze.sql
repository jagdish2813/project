  # Fix designer access to assigned customer projects

  1. Policy Updates
    - Create specific policy for designers to view only assigned projects
    - Update customer update policy to allow assigned designers to edit
    - Maintain project_shares policy for email-based sharing

  2. Security
    - Remove overly broad policies
    - Ensure proper access control for assigned projects
    - Maintain customer privacy for unassigned projects
    - Use function instead of view for better RLS support
