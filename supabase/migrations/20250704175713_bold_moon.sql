  # Add Customer Quotes Function

  1. New Function
    - Create a database function to retrieve customer quotes with items
    - Simplify client-side code by handling joins and item fetching in the database
    - Ensure proper security with RLS

  2. Security
    - Function is security definer to bypass RLS
    - Function checks user ID to ensure only authorized users can access their quotes
